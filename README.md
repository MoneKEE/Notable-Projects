## Charge Master Data Preprocessing Tool

##### Created: Jan 2016

Optimized data integrity and reduced turnaround time for committing batches of new chargeable services to the production Charge Data Master (CDM).  Built using Excel, Access and VBA this tool evaluates proposed charge items to ensure adherence to enterprise data quality standards, like string length restrictions and allowable values, and produces a series of flat files that are ready for import into the organization’s healthcare information system, Eagle 2000, allowing for same-day completion of charge creation requests.  This solution replaced a largely manual process that could take days to complete.

## Eagle HIS User Security Audit Tool

##### Created: Jul 2017

A system configuration analysis tool which provides a faster, visual means for profiling individual user menu and security level assignments within the company’s healthcare information system, Eagle 2000. Built using Access, Excel and VBA the tool generates an Entity Relationship Diagram based on user and menu schema data, illustrating a top-to-bottom view of all accessible and non-accessible menus, screens and functions.  This tool is routinely used to perform system security audits and supplanted preexisting procedures involving the review of tabular data.
